# Log-API-Node

This is my portfolio piece to show off my fast growing fullstack developer skills. The basic RESTful CRUD API is now fully functional and I am now working on implementing authentication. The code uses Node JS, Express, and MongoDB. Eventually, I will also redo the front end using React to make this a MERN stack portfolio piece.

The dependencies can be seen in [this](https://github.com/Mark-Platts/Log-API-Node/blob/main/server/package.json) file.

If you would like to download and run this yourself. Simply run 'npm start' in the server directory. Then open index.html from the client directory to see the interface.

At the moment. The project is a simple 'Log tool' for submitting and reading text logs. The CRUD operations are all functional, and the front end connects to the API via fetch requests. As stated above, I am currently working on allowing seperate user functionality and authentication.

Here is what the interface looks like. The layout and CSS are all my design.
